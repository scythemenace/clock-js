### Completed 3 tasks:-

## Task 1 (counter.js):- 
  - Designed a counter that runs from 30 seconds to 0
## Task 2 (timeTaken.js):-
  - Verified whether the setTimeout() actually runs after 1 second (if the second param is 1000).
  - Result came out to be an average 1.025 seconds which means it takes approximately 0.25 seconds more for the setTimeout() function to actually run because of function call delay.
## Task 3 (clock.js):-
  - Created a terminal clock that runs for the number of seconds specified.
  - This file has to be run using ```node clock.js``` command because prompt() and process.stdout are being used here to interact with the terminal
  - The clock gets updated on the same line in the terminal until the time runs out.
